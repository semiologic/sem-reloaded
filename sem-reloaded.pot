"The gist, here, is to remember that the C in CSS stands for cascading and "
"that CSS is applied on a &quot;last strongest declaration gets used&quot; "
"basis (i.e. mind the order). `foo`, `.foo`, and `#foo` are interchangeable "
"in CSS-compliant browsers; `foo.bar` is stronger than `foo`, and `foo bar` "

"`#foo`; to affect `bar` within a particular area, use `.foo bar` or `#foo "
"bar`."
